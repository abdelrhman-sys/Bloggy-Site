# Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a Blog web application using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The application will allow users to create and view blog posts.

3. Post Update/Delete: Users can edit and delete posts as needed.

3. Styling: The application is well-styled and responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
## Technical Requirements
1. Node.js & Express.js: The application is a web server built using Node.js and Express.js. Express.js handles routing and middleware.
2. EJS: EJS is used as the templating engine to generate dynamic HTML based on the application's state.
